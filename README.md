# Escher: A language for programming in pure metaphors

Escher is a simple syntax for representing generic labeled graphs called _circuits_, much like
XML is a (not-so-simple) syntax for representing generic labeled trees.

Escher graphs can also be interpreted as executable circuits of independent processing
units. In this way, Escher circuits (used as code) can manipulate Escher circuits (representing data),
thus achieving linguistic uniformity between algorithm and data.

In contrast, the standard language for manipulating XML—JavaScript—being designed
after-the-fact, constitutes an altogether unrelated semantic and syntax compared to XML.
