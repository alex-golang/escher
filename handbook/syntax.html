<h1>Syntax and meaning</h1>
<p>At its heart Escher is a Go package that parses a simple written syntax
into a labeled graph data structure, called a <em>circuit</em>. If you view
XML as a syntax that represents labeled trees, then Escher would be a 
syntax that represents labeled graphs.

<h2>Circuits</h2>

<p>A circuit consists of nodes, called <em>gates</em>, which have
a name and a value. Names are strings or integers. Gates have unique names
within a circuit. Values are anything (representable by the underlying
technology, in this case Go).

<p>Additionally, a circuit has a set of <em>links</em> across pairs of gates.
A link has two endpoints, called <em>vectors</em>.
Each vector consists of a gate name and a <em>valve</em>
name. Vectors do not overlap in the sense that all vectors with the
same gate name have unique valve names.

<h2>Symbolism</h2>

<p>Circuits have a standard visual representation that fully captures
the <em>internal</em> structure of the circuit, which consists of the
gate names and links and excludes the gate values—the <em>external</em> structure.

<h2>Grammar</h2>

<p>A <em>definition</em> starts with a circuit name followed by a circuit description
inside brackets. The name is an identifier, beginning with a non-digit.
For instance,

<pre>
alpha {
	…
}
</pre>

<p>Between the brackets, one can have any number of statements which are of two kinds:
<em>gates</em> and <em>links</em>.

<p>Gate statements begin on a new line with a gate name identifier, space, and a gate value expression.
There are six value types that can be expressed:
<ul>
<li>Integers
<li>Floating-point numbers
<li>Complex numbers
<li>Strings
<li>Addresses
<li>Circuits
</ul>

<p>The first four correspond to the Go types <code>int</code>, <code>float64</code>, <code>complex128</code>
and <code>string</code> and are expressed using the same syntax. 
Addresses have a dedicated Go type <code>Address</code>. They represent a sequence of names and are
written as dot-separated fully-qualified names. Finally, circuits—whose dedicated Go type is <code>Circuit</code>—
can be values of gates as well.

<p>For instance,

<pre>
alpha {
	address    fully.qualified.Name
	integral   123
	floating   3.14
	complex    (1-3i)
	quoted     "abcd\n\tefgh"
	backquoted `
		&lt;html&gt;
			&lt;div&gt;abc&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/html&gt;
	`
	…
}
</pre>

<p>Gate values can be circuits themselves,

<pre>
alpha {
	circuit {
		Hello World
		Foo   "Bar"
	}
	…
}
</pre>

<p>Go-style end-of-line comments are allowed everywhere.
