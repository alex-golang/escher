Every discontinuity in perception is followed by an emotion or preceded by action.

Formally:

Consciousness is a sequence of experiences.
Each experience has a previous and a next.
There are three types of experiences (in no particular order): Perception, Action, Emotion.
There are two states of perception: Flow and X.

Flow is preceded by action.
X is followed by emotion.
