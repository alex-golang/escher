The language between the science of the West and the mysticism of the East

Many westerners (myself, in an earlier time, included) appreciate and enjoy
the mysticism of the eastern cultures, but do not understand them (self-admittedly),
especially when claims of life after death and transcendance and levitation
surface themselves.

As a “concrete thinker” with a backbone of 30+ years of predominantly
mathematical and theoretical thinking (it is my profession) I have come
to discover a perfectly clear connection between the western concepts of
Math and Theoretical Computer Science and various eastern sciences
like “Patanjali's Yoga System” or the various Buddhist meditation teachings.

The connectiont is beautifully simple and concrete: 
Language, its meaning and the people who are the 
carriers and makers of that meaning.
